# Installation

## Using Pip

Go to the directory of sources and start your terminal there or ``cd`` to it.
Because currently we don't have `PyPI` package yet.
Also you should have ``setuptools`` and ``wheel`` for building the wheel


for ``setuptools`` and ``wheel`` and if you have them already you can skip them

``
pip install wheel setuptools
``

``pip install .`` to install the package

directory it take effect and this very helpful for development

``pip install -e .``
